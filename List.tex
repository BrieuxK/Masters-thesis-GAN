\section{Skills acquired during the project}

During this thesis, I had to use an array of new concepts and tools. Here is a summary :

\paragraph{Software}
\begin{itemize}
    \item MadGraph and one of its model, the 2HDM, to generate the initial training sample
    \item ROOT (on Ubuntu), to open the different .root files used and to check their content
    \item Delphes, to simulate a (simplified) detector response, still for the initial sample
\end{itemize}

\paragraph{Packages}
\begin{itemize}
    \item Keras, for machine learning
    \item TensorFlow, for machine learning
    \item uproot, for manipulating .root files
    \item scipy, for tools as mutual information and KS
    \item awkward arrays, type of arrays used in the .root files
\end{itemize}

\paragraph{Machine learning}
\begin{itemize}
    \item GAN, cGAN and "blinded" cGAN
    \item brief introduction to the concept of normalizing flows
    \item plenty of different tools to ease the convergence of a network : dynamic learning rate techniques, \textit{He} initialization, gradient clipping, ...
\end{itemize}

\paragraph{Soft skills}
\begin{itemize}
    \item better english skills, both active and passive
\end{itemize}
